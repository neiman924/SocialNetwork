# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description 

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that we understand how to build and structure the API first.

In this homework I'm building an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

I created my own data and seed process and using Insomnia after I created APIs.
